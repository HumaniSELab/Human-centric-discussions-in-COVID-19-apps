英語学習のために、スマートフォンの言語設定を英語にしています。このアプリで は端末の言語設定がそのまま反映されるので、アプリの言語は自動的に英語になります。 感染者と接触があった場合に、保健所などに画面を提示する必要が出てくる場合があるようですが、英語設定のままでも対応してもらえるのでしょうか？ 日本語でないといけないようであれば、アプリ内で簡単に言語設定を変えられるように仕様変更していただけるといいと思います。,3,For learning English  I am setting the language of my smartphone to English. In this app  the language setting of the device is reflected as it is  so the language of the app is automatically English. It seems that it may be necessary to present the screen to a public health center when there is contact with an infected person. Is it possible to respond even with the English setting? If you have to use Japanese  I would like you to change the specifications so that you can easily change the language setting in the application.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,
"海外在住で、英語設定の海外スマホと居住国が日本以外のGoogleアカウントを用いてインストールしましたが全てスムーズです。気になる点は(1) 英語版の登録名にある""MHLW official""は日本人の私にもハテナ? です (2) アプリ自体はよく英語化されているのですが、スプラッシュスクリーンとアプリ上部のバナーに日本語が残るのは気になります。特に旅行者にとっては読めない文字で書かれたものは何かしら不安を感じます。厳しい言い方をすればアマビエも日本人の間だけで通じる内輪ネタで英語版のスプラッシュスクリーンには相応しくないです。シンプルな英語のみのスプラッシュとバナーにして、アマビエについては別途アプリ内に紹介ページを設けた方がよいと思います。",5,"I live abroad  and the English-language overseas smartphone and my country of residence installed it using a Google account other than Japan  but everything is smooth. Points to be worried about (1) ""MHLW official"" in the English version's registered name is a Japanese even I'm Hatena? (2) The app itself is often translated into English  but the splash screen and the upper part of the app I am worried that Japanese will remain on the banner. In particular  I feel uneasy about what is written in unreadable characters for travelers. To put it strictly  Amabier is an inside story that only Japanese people can understand  and it is not suitable for the English version of the splash screen. It's better to have a simple English-only splash and banner  and to have a separate introduction page in the app for Amabier.",,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1

"Auf einmal geht die Hauptfunktion Risikoerkennung nicht mehr. Angeblich inbes. bei bestimmten HandyMarken nicht.

Hardly installed (almost with the very first + new app in the Playstore)  then an update and then the app is unusable (Google API error). Allegedly  the app continues to collect encounter data ... The proximity to Google is just big crap. The cooperation with Google to save programming time now only serves the benefit of the data octopus than the general public. To deinstall.,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,

"Ich habe die App gerade wieder deinstalliert. Sie forderte mich auf, meine Standortabfrage zu aktivieren. Dadurch könnten ALLE anderen Apps, wie z.b. Google-Maps, auf meinen Standort zurückgreifen.

Für mich kommt die Warn-App daher nicht in Frage, denn ich möchte Google meine Geo-Daten definitiv nicht zur Verfügung stellen.",1,I just uninstalled the app again. She asked me to activate my location query. This could ALL other apps  such as Google Maps  use my location. Geo-tracking is done indirectly via the app. The warning app is therefore out of the question for me  because I definitely do not want to make my geo data available to Google.,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1

Bei mir funktioniert die App ganz gut aber ich werde sie solange wie dazu der GPS aktiviert sein muss nicht nutzen da Handys und generell Mobilgeräte kein GPS braucht um mit anderen Geräten zu kommunizieren - Oder macht ihr GPS an wenn ihr euch mit euren Kopfhörer verbinden wollt? - Wenn das Robert Koch Institut die App so programmiert dass man keine Standortermittlung mehr braucht lade ich sie mir wieder runter und aktiviere sie wieder.,3,The app works quite well for me  but I won't use it as long as the GPS has to be activated because cell phones and mobile devices in general don't need GPS to communicate with other devices - or do you turn on GPS when you want to connect to your headphones? - When the Robert Koch Institute programs the app in such a way that you no longer need to determine your location  I download it again and activate it again.,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1
