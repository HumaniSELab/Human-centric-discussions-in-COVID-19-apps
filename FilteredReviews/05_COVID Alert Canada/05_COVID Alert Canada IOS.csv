This app only works for two provinces right now... Ontario and NFLD. That is not good enough to deal with this pandemic.

I contacted the support team to find out what we as individuals need to do get our provinces to use this app. Sadly, all I got was canned messages that didn’t have any real substance or info in them. In addition, reading about the 15 min minimum exposure time is also a concern as we need to know about even shorter exposure times. All of this is not reassuring at all and makes me doubt the effectiveness of the app itself.

REPLY TO DEV RESPONSE:
A “national” app that works in only two provinces is not a national app. That is like having an app for a restaurant that only has one location in one province – Sure, any Canadian can download the app, but it only serves a limited range and number of people.

This app has been out for MONTHS and if all provinces wanted this app, it would have been implemented Canada-wide. While you say YOU are working with each province’s health authority to make the app/data work for them, WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG? Why not tell us Canadians what we need to do to encourage our local authorities to adopt this app??","  Support FAIL First of all, I WISH this app was truly a national app but...

This app only works for two provinces right now... Ontario and NFLD. That is not good enough to deal with this pandemic.

I contacted the support team to find out what we as individuals need to do get our provinces to use this app. Sadly, all I got was canned messages that didn’t have any real substance or info in them. In addition, reading about the 15 min minimum exposure time is also a concern as we need to know about even shorter exposure times. All of this is not reassuring at all and makes me doubt the effectiveness of the app itself.

REPLY TO DEV RESPONSE:
A “national” app that works in only two provinces is not a national app. That is like having an app for a restaurant that only has one location in one province – Sure, any Canadian can download the app, but it only serves a limited range and number of people.

This app has been out for MONTHS and if all provinces wanted this app, it would have been implemented Canada-wide.

The fact that it's not cross compatable with older phones seriously decreases the amount of people using it thus decreases the effectiveness of it. 

Furthurmore, the amount of battery usage this app uses is immense. I've had it downloaded for about 30 minutes and my phone has gone from 90% to 20%. Also, the location services freezes when trying to change settings in system preferences. There is no work around to resolve this and is the ultimate reason for me to uninstall as it basically bricks my phone.

Another problem is the 15 minute timeframe you have to be exposed to is really inadequate (even though it's recommended by health officials). It's quite possible to be in close proximity to someone (say in an elevator) for 5 minutes and be exposed, but not really be sure.

If the Canadian government is really serious about using this app they need to invest more money into it to properly build the user base to make it effective. Otherwise, if it stays at this level of workability it is just a waste of resources. To call it a tool amongst many is inaccurate. Even if they only plan on a small user base using it the negatives outweigh the benefits and they should really be spending these resources elsewhere.","  Good Idea - Poor Execution Yeah...

Upon opening the app for the first time, it will make you swipe through some screens that explain how the app works to keep you safe and protect your privacy.

The app estimates how near people are by the strength of Bluetooth signals. It seems to set a high bar for what it records as an exposure. As it is now, it will only record an exposure if you are closer than 2 meters for 15 minutes. Apple’s and Google’s exposure notification API measures exposure duration in 5-minute increments, so I believe the 15-minute requirement could be adjusted down to 10 minutes or 5 minutes in the future if health authorities feel that is necessary.

As the bar seems to be set high for what is recorded as an exposure, if you do get a notification you should take it seriously and go get tested.

There is really no reason to not download the app. It has been designed with privacy as the top priority, keeping your data in your hands. Apple has also designed the Exposure Notification API to be very lightweight and integrated with iOS, so it can run in the background without having a noticeable impact on battery life or performance.

Please download the app and help keep your fellow Canadians safe and healthy. 🇨🇦  ",en,  First Impressions are Excellent I downloaded the app and got it working without any issues    Upon opening the app for the first time  it will make you swipe through some screens that explain how the app works to keep you safe and protect your privacy   The app estimates how near people are by the strength of Bluetooth signals  It seems to set a high bar for what it records as an exposure  As it is now  it will only record an exposure if you are closer than   meters for    minutes  Apple s and Google s exposure notification API measures exposure duration in   minute increments  so I believe the    minute requirement could be adjusted down to    minutes or   minutes in the future if health authorities feel that is necessary   As the bar seems to be set high for what is recorded as an exposure  if you do get a notification you should take it seriously and go get tested    There is really no reason to not download the app  It has been designed with privacy as the top priority  keeping your data in your hands  Apple has also designed the Exposure Notification API to be very lightweight and integrated with iOS  so it can run in the background without having a noticeable impact on battery life or performance   Please download the app and help keep your fellow Canadians safe and healthy      ,"Domain_Specific, Privacy","data, privaci, protect, perform, author, record, measur, author, run, signal",0.085470085,Positive,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
