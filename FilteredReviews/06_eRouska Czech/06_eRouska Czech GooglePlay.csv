Nelze registrovat pevná linka, ale já v mobilu mám jen data a VOIP pevnou linku, aplikace použitelná jen pro někoho. Nutnost zapnutého GPS to je max na 5 hodin provozu u běžných telefonů, ale telefon potřebuji minimálně 10 hodin denně. Účel zapnutého bluetooth absolutně nechápu, zvláště mám-li vypnutou viditelnost a pokud je viditelnost bluetooth obejitá, pak nemám záruku bezpečí a telefon mi může kdokoliv napadnout třeba právě za pomoci této aplikace. Také nemám jistotu že sledování mého pohybu nebude využito jinak viz nedávné řešení sledování automobilů stran BIS a to že někdo napíše že mě nesledují, je jen cár papíru kterej snese všechno. Z mého pohledu se se domnívám, že se jedná o aplikaci využívající COVID jako zástěrku pro sledování občanů a případné využití pro omezení šíření nákazy je jen krytí primárního účelu tedy sledování, což nepíšu jako realitu ale jako domněnku jak sem již uvedl.
