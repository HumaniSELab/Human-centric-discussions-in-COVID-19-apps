I was unable to access the full text of one of the notifications, both of which are permanently lost.  Developer, can you please address this seemingly significant functionality issue in a future release, in order to improve the app’s feedback to the user.

My original comment follows, with (I presume)  initial developer response:
When Bluetooth is turned off within the iPhone itself, via the panel, the app continues to report that it is active and scanning. A visible warning from the app that iOS Bluetooth is off (eg a message on the Home or Lock Screens?) could be helpful to avoid misunderstanding of actual status.

Popped in my postcode and it tells me the risk of COVID in my area. I go to places and “check in” by scanning the barcodes, and the app seems to behave well enough.
The information in the app is actually useful - there’s a lot of nonsense about COVID spreading online and through WhatsApp, so it’s nice to have a very clear and definitive place where I can get that information in an easy to read, centralised place.
Others have said it would be nice to track where you are going and update COVID based on that - I think that was omitted to prevent people thinking the app is spying on them, which in that case, good on the developers for being conscious enough to see how it could be perceived by the public and taking action towards reducing that risk of not being able to download. I think a good compromise is a heat map of the UK where people can see where COVID is at high risk without GPS access to keep the data private.
All in all, a good effort on the app. Being an app developer myself, I know how hard it is to get decent feedback so I hope this helps the people behind the app improve but encourage them with the app.","  Seems decent enough Tried it as it seems to be pretty simple and intuitive enough to use.
