しかし、濃厚接触の可能性と知らせてくれた後、連絡をしてくれと書かれた問い合わせ先は電話が通じず、保健所や帰国者・接触者相談センターに連絡をしても医師に相談してほしいと言われ、何軒かの病院に問い合わせ医師に相談をしても症状が出るまではそのままの生活で、症状が出ない限りは保険適用で検査はできないと…
結局、体調の変化はなかったものの、陽性者と接触した事により感染の恐怖は付きまとい、家族や職場でもずっと不安なまま、結局自費で4万近く支払い検査に行く事に、結果は陰性。
何が正解かわかりませんが、バグもあり、本当に接触していたのかもよくわからず、不安にだけさせて問い合わせにも応じてもらえず、結局自分で色んなところに問い合わせ高額の検査を受ける事になり、このアプリの意味がよくわからなくなりました。

評判を見ていると地獄のようだ。少し調べれば1日の全接触回数を表示する機能は「調整中（プライバシー面やAppleとGoogleが作ったコア機能上の制限が原因？）」であることが5月26日付の厚生労働省が示している仕様書で素人でもすぐ分かる。設計段階で一応検討はなされており、実装可能であれば今後アプデが入るし、不能であれば仕方がない、ということはしばらく待てば分かることだがそれに要望や文句を言ってどうするんだ。

アプリの規約等を一切読まずに憶測だけで批判し、の割にSNSの情報は鵜呑みにしてうがい薬の買い占めに走る。本当に肝心な所が抜けている人が多いように感じる。

そして1,000万ダウンロード突破おめでとうございます。陽性者登録も徐々に増えているようで、わずかでも早期に感染に気付ける可能性があることに安心感があります。国がダウンロードを義務付けるのは憲法？法律？上無理なようですが、自治体や商業施設が独自に接触確認アプリのダウンロード者を優遇するキャンペーンとかを打ち出していく風潮が今後できればな…とちょっとした期待をしています。

○2020/7/13

陽性者のうちアプリを所持し、かつ匿名での陽性者登録を行なった人はごく少数であるとの報道が出ました。しかし私はこの病気が怖いので、身近な人のためにも少しでも早く自分が感染した可能性があることを知りたいと思いますし、接触通知を受けることで無症状であっても検査を受けることができるようなのでそれだけで価値があると感じて入れています。

接触確認機能の有効化時に個人情報の入力は一切無く、一般向けの仕様書？みたいなのを読み開発者さえもアプリ所持者の情報を閲覧できないことを知った上でインストールしました。そもそも機能のコアを作ったのは政府や有志の開発者ではなく、AppleとGoogleですからね。「登録者が少なくて意味が無いから」「政府が信用できないから」程度の理由でこのアプリを入れない意味がわかりません。意図的に入れない人は政府に抵抗している気にでもなっているつもりなのか？このご時世、その不作為は既に他人に被害を与えていますし、いつかは巡ってあなたの元へやって来ますよ。

接触確認機能自体はじきにApple・GoogleによりOSレベルで実装されるとの記事を以前見かけました。それまでの繋ぎのアプリではありますが、サイズも100MB程度で、一度機能を有効化したら通知を待つだけでほぼ起動することはなく手軽です。不具合修正も大きく遅れることは今のところありません。もっと普及して欲しい。","I want everyone to use it ○ Added August 6  2020

Looking at the reputation is like hell. The Ministry of Health  Labor and Welfare on May 26 showed that the function to display the total number of contacts per day is ""adjusting (due to privacy or restrictions on core functions made by Apple and Google?)"" Even the layperson can easily understand the specifications. It is considered at the design stage  and if it can be implemented  it will be added in the future  and if it can not be implemented  it will be unavoidable  but after waiting for a while  I will make a request or complain.

He criticizes only by speculation without reading the terms of the app at all  and in spite of this  he swallows the information on SNS and runs to buy mouthwash. I feel that there are many people who really miss the important points.

And congratulations on exceeding 10 million downloads. It seems that the number of positive person registrations is gradually increasing  and I am reassured that I may be aware of the infection even slightly. Is the country required to download the constitution? law? It seems unreasonable  but I hope that local governments and commercial facilities will launch a campaign to give preferential treatment to downloaders of contact confirmation apps in the future...

○2020/7/13

It was reported that only a small number of positive people possessed the app and registered anonymously as positive people. However  I am afraid of this disease  so I would like to know that I may have become infected as soon as possible even for people around me  and by receiving contact notification I will be able to test even if there are no symptoms. It seems that I can receive it  so I feel that it is worth it.

There is no input of personal information when the contact confirmation function is enabled  and is it a specification for the general public? It was installed after knowing that even developers could not browse the information of the owner of the application. In the first place  it wasn't the government or volunteer developers that made the core of the feature  but Apple and Google. I don't understand why you can't use this app for the reason of ""because there are few registered people and it doesn't make sense"" or ""because the government cannot trust"". Do you think that those who are intentionally unable to enter will feel like resisting the government? In this age  the inaction has already done harm to others  and one day I will come around to you.

I saw an article before that the contact confirmation function itself will be implemented at the OS level by Apple/Google soon.

そして，本アプリケーションを開発は，有志の方々がボランティアで行っているとのことで，ただただ感謝するしかありません．

操作に関しては至ってシンプルで，何もこちらで考えなくとも自然と扱うことのできる作りです．強いて言うのであれば，接触の確認をアプリケーション立ち上げた際の一面に表示するように変更するともっとわかりやすいかもしれません．

他の方も仰っていますが，IE縛りの古くさい国の電子システムから一気にモダンなアプリケーションをリリースできたのは，開発者のスキルの高さと熱意そのものだと感じています．電池の減りは気になりません．こちらは端末そのものの性能故のものでしょうか．Bluetooth自体もBluetooth Low Energyなる省電力規格も普及しているので，さほど問題にすべきことでもないでしょう．

レビュー見ると気になりましたので書きますが，無知な人間が勝手な思い込みと噂話に踊らされて猛烈な暴言と批判をしています．正直とてもみっともないです．理数科目から目を背けてきた方，アプリケーションを作ったことがない方，技術を正しく認識していない方，こういった方が大体騒ぎます．はずかしくないのでしょうか．

I am deeply moved when the system that confirms the contact of coronavirus and calls attention to each action starts full-scale operation. In the first place  it was known that there were bugs at the beginning of the release  and it was a trial operation for one month. Perhaps it is actually used by a large number of users to fix bugs and fine-tune it.

And  it is said that volunteers are volunteering to develop this application  so I can only thank you.

The operation is very simple  and you can handle it naturally without thinking anything here. If you want to force it  it may be easier to understand if you change the contact confirmation to be displayed on one side when the application is launched.

As others have said  I feel that it was the skill and enthusiasm of the developers that made it possible to release modern applications all at once from an electronic system in an IE-bound country. Don't worry about the battery running out. Is this due to the performance of the terminal itself? Since both Bluetooth itself and Bluetooth Low Energy power saving standards are widespread  it should not be a big problem.

I am worried when I see the review  so I will write  but ignorant human beings are violently abusive and criticized by selfish beliefs and rumors. To be honest  it's not very good.

今後の備えのためにインストールしました。
未就学児のため、機会は減らしているとはいえ外出で買い物に出かけなければならないこともしばしば。

他の方と同意見で、医療施設や検査機関の権限で陽性者の登録とアプリの常時起動と携帯義務が必要だと思います。匿名性のある機能なので陽性者の方々の理解を得る働きかけも必要なのでしょうね。

また、接触の定義が「15分1メートル以内」というものですが、心境は接触自体を避け感染を回避したいですし、またそれが可能な生活環境なのでそれを通知してくださる機能が選べるようになれば嬉しいです。

以下は個人的な妄想です、このアプリと施設が連動して陽性者とその接触の疑いある方が入場した場合に、消毒やマスクの励行を促したり、一定数の入場がわかった場合のみ施設管理者にクラスター防止の措置として入場制限を設けたりなどなど、使い道はかなり広くありそうです。

このアプリの普及は、外出の安心が手に入ることなのだと感じます。
もちろんこれ以上の感染が広がらないことが一番ですし、もちろん陽性者の方々の肩身を狭くするような事がないような配慮が利用者に求められます。

Also  the definition of contact is ""within 15 minutes and 1 meter""  but I want to avoid contact itself and avoid infection  and because it is a living environment where I can choose the function to notify it. I would be happy if that happens.

The following are personal delusions.If this app and the facility are linked  positive people and people suspected of their contact will enter the facility  and only if you know that a certain number of people are admitted It seems that the usage is quite wide such as setting entrance restrictions as a measure to prevent clusters for administrators.

このアプリをリリース日から本日7月12日まで入れていましたが、バッテリー消費が激しすぎます。

今までは毎日朝から晩まで追加充電なしで過ごせました。(一日の終わりで残り52％前後ある)

しかし、COCOAを入れてから毎日3回追加充電しないとバッテリー切れを起こすようになりました。
お昼すぎでバッテリーが1桁台になった時は思わず声が出ました。

バッテリー消費グラフも、ヘルスケア(COVID-19接触記録)の項目がかなり上位、酷い時は64％も食っていてバッテリーがどんどん無くなります。

とてもこのようなアプリを入れていてはバッテリーの劣化が通常の数倍近くまで行きそうな上、携帯電話としての機能も失いかねないのでアンインストールしました。

もっと入れて欲しいならさらにバッテリー消費を軽減できるようにしてください。

完璧なアプリを作れとは言いませんが、単純計算でバッテリー消費量が概ね3倍以上にもなるアプリを入れる訳にはいきません。
挙句の果てに不具合だらけ。
もっとまともにしてから出した方がいいとも思いますよ。

Until now  I was able to spend every day from morning to evening without additional charging. (At the end of the day  there is about 52% remaining)

However  if COCOA is inserted and the battery is not recharged three times daily  the battery will run out.
When the battery was in the single-digit range after lunch  I suddenly heard a voice.

Also in the battery consumption graph  the item of health care (COVID-19 contact record) is quite high  64% is eaten when it is terrible  and the battery disappears steadily.

I've uninstalled such an app because it's likely that the battery will deteriorate to several times the normal level and the function as a mobile phone may be lost.

If you want more  please try to reduce the battery consumption further.

I can't say that I can make a perfect app  but I can't put an app that consumes more than 3 times more battery power by simple calculation.
There are many defects at the end of the story.
I think it's better to do it more properly.

Some people have said that TPO has a feeling of deterioration  but it is an undeniable fact  and generally speaking  it is the consumption level at the defect level.

14 days after installation should be watched but say not watched

Was it made by the Japanese government?

Not usable

省エネなBluetooth LE接続を使用します。
Bluetooth LE接続なので、無線イヤホンやApple Pencilなどを繋ぐ時(ペアリング)とは違うタイプのBluetoothです。コントロールセンターでBluetooth ON(青色表示)にする必要も無いそうです。
バッテリーの減りは今のところ気になりません。

Bluetoothは赤外線(テレビのリモコンなどで使用されている無線通信)の強化版なので、通信料金(円)やデータ利用量(GB／ギガバイト)はかかりません。

GPSを使用しません。
位置情報ではなく、アプリがインストールされている携帯端末(スマートフォン)同士が接触したかどうかをBluetoothで記録しているだけです。
GPSを使用しないのでバッテリー消費はありません。

記録されるのはアプリ側から割り振られる端末の「接触符号(端末の出席番号のようなもの)」と、接触符号同士が接近した際の「接触情報(すれ違い情報)」です。名前や電話番号などの個人情報は不要です。入力画面も出てきません。(アプリ内の説明イラスト画面がとてもわかりやすいです)

この3点は利用者を増やすために重要なポイントだと思うので、よく考えられているなと思いました。

ユーザー側の協力が必要なアプリです。
アプリ利用者同士でしか接触の有無を確認できません。そのため、1人でも多くのユーザーにこのアプリを正しく理解して納得の上で利用してもらう必要があります。

多くの人が利用して初めて役に立つアプリです。
自分だけでなく、家族や友人、医療関係者や病気と闘いながら働いている店員さんなど知らない誰かのためにもインストールしておきたいアプリです。

そして、検査陽性と出たら自主的にアプリで陽性者登録の操作をする必要があります。(情報は匿名です)

嘘の陽性登録はできません。
検査陽性の際に発行される番号がないと、陽性登録はできない仕組みになっています。適当な番号で画面を進めることができたとしても、その場合は正式な登録処理はされないので大丈夫とのことです。(開発者のツイート)

有志のエンジニア達が「この状況をどうにかしたい」と無償で作ったアプリです。
開発途中から厚生労働省との連携がされたそうです。開発者は政府関係者ではありません。ですので、「国家が国民を管理するために作ったアプリ」ではありません。

オープンソースという無償配布形式のものです。
開発者の方が「他国でも利用してもらえるように」「より多くの人の助けになるように」とボランティアで考案、開発、提供してくれたアプリです。「国家がエンジニアにただ働きさせて作ったアプリ」ではありません。

これらのアプリ開発者の記事がネットニュースに出ています。開発の意図や使用される情報、ユーザーが増えることで精度が上がるアプリであることなどを理解した上で是非使っていただきたいです。(このレビューはアプリに対するレビューであり、現政権を支持するものではありません)","A well-considered application to increase the number of users After initial setting  simply insert the application.
You will receive a notification if you contact a positive person. It is a very handy app.

Write the description on the application  the actual usage status  and the contents written in the Q&A. Please refer to it if necessary.

Use the energy-saving Bluetooth LE connection.
Since it is a Bluetooth LE connection  it is a different type of Bluetooth from when connecting wireless earphones or Apple Pencil (pairing). It seems that there is no need to turn on Bluetooth (displayed in blue) at the control center.
I'm not worried about the low battery.

Since Bluetooth is an enhanced version of infrared rays (wireless communication used for TV remote controls  etc.)  communication charges (yen) and data usage (GB/gigabyte) are not charged.

Does not use GPS.
Instead of location information  it only records with Bluetooth whether the mobile terminals (smartphones) where the application is installed have contacted each other.
There is no battery consumption because it does not use GPS.

The information is anonymous.
What is recorded is the “contact code (like the attendance number of the terminal)” of the terminal allocated from the application side and the “contact information (passing information)” when the contact codes approach each other. No personal information such as name or phone number is required. No input screen appears. (The illustration screen in the app is very easy to understand)

I think these three points are important points for increasing the number of users  so I thought they are not well thought out.

It is an application that requires cooperation from the user side.
Only users of the app can confirm the contact. Therefore  it is necessary for as many users as possible to understand and understand this app properly before using it.

It is an application that is useful only to many people.
It is an app you want to install not only for yourself but also for someone you do not know  such as family members  friends  medical staff  and salesclerks who are working while fighting illness.

And if you get a positive test  you need to voluntarily operate the positive person registration with the application. (The information is anonymous)

False positive registration is not possible.
If there is no number issued when the test is positive  positive registration is not possible. Even if you can proceed with the screen with an appropriate number  in that case it is okay because the official registration process will not be done. (Tweet by the developer)

It is an app that volunteer engineers made for free saying ""I want to manage this situation"".
It seems that a link with the Ministry of Health  Labor and Welfare was made during the development. Developers are not government officials. Therefore  it is not an ""app made by the nation to manage the people"".

It is a free distribution format called open source.
It is an app that the developers devised  developed  and provided by volunteers  ""to be used in other countries"" and ""to help more people."" It's not ""an app that the nation just made engineers work.""

Articles from these app developers are available on NetNews. I would like you to use it after understanding the intention of development  the information used  and the fact that it is an application whose accuracy increases as the number of users increases.

金曜にインストールして、土日は気になる事もなくすごしました(ほぼ自宅のwifi環境)が、月曜は仕事でして、バッテリーの減りが多すぎました。ヘルスアプリのコロナ関係が動いているようです。ヘルスアプリのモバイル通信は許可していません。2gbまでの契約の為、wihi接続時のみデータを送信するように出来ませんか。
もしくは、契約に関係なく通信し放題になるようにしてくれませんか。何回か限度まで行った時に不都合があったので、怖くてモバイル通信の許可が出せません。
Ios11からios12に更新した時に、月初の５日から通信制限がされました。おそらく、対応していないアプリが使ったんでしょうが、26日も制限されたらキャッシュレス払いにも時間がかかって困りました。

I installed it on Friday and spent it on Saturdays and Sundays without any worries (almost at home in the wifi environment)  but I did work on Mondays and the battery drained too much. The corona relationship in the health app seems to be working. Mobile communication of health app is not allowed. Since it is a contract up to 2gb  can you send data only when connecting to wihi?
Or  will you allow me to communicate as much as I want regardless of the contract? I was inconvenient when I went to the limit a few times  so I am afraid that I cannot give permission for mobile communication.
When I updated from Ios11 to ios12  communication was restricted from the 5th of the first month. Perhaps I used an application that does not support it  but I was troubled that cashless payment also took time if it was limited for 26 days.

今後予測される第二波の流行・医療崩壊を防ぐためにも、なるべく多くの人がインストールすることが大事になってきます。

インストールしたら短いセットアップがあるので、まずはそこまで進めましょう。

身近にアプリのインストール方法が分からない人がいたら手伝ってあげましょう。

短期間で完成が求められ、かつ前例のないことなので、リリースまでに大変な苦労があったのではないかと思います。開発者の方、関係者の方、お疲れ様でした。本当にありがとうございます。
