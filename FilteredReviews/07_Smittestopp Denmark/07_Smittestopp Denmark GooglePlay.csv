Hvis det virkelig skulle batte noget, så skulle app'en være fælleseuropæisk, i stedet for at hvert enkelt land laver sin egen app, uden mulighed for udveksling med de andre landes - især efterhånden som grænserne åbnes. Og nå ja, endnu engang viser det offentlige danmark hvor elendige de er til udvikling: App'ens har en ret begrænset funktion - den er ikke fyldt med grafik, den skal udelukkende kommunikere små tilfældigt generede nøgler med andre telefoner, uploade dem til en server og måske vise en notifikation, hvis du har været tæt på en smittet. Alligevel fylder den vanvittige 86 (seksogfirs!) megabyte!? Har i skrevet den i BASIC og pakket fortolkeren med i pakken, eller hvad sker der? Det er jo helt i hegnet, og kan ikke gøre andet end at vække mistanke om at den kan (og gør) en hel del mere end i vil indrømme! Til sammenligning: Spotify-app'en fylder 26 MiB, altså mindre end en tredjedel. Fair nok at den kræver iOS 13.5 - det er ikke jeres skyld at Apple kun har rullet api'et i bruger ud på den version - men at lave den så stor, er det for at sikre jeg at så få som muligt henter den (så i ikke skal kigge så mange data igennem?

If it really had to beat something  then the app should be pan-European  instead of each country making its own app  without the possibility of exchanging with the other countries - especially as the borders are opened. And well yes  once again the public denmark shows how miserable they are for development: The app has a rather limited function - it is not filled with graphics  it only has to communicate small randomly generated keys with other phones  upload them to a server and may display a notification if you have been close to an infected person. Still  the insane 86 (eighty-six!) Megabytes !? Have you written it in BASIC and packed the interpreter in the package  or what happens? It is completely in the fence  and can do nothing but arouse suspicion that it can (and does) a lot more than you will admit! For comparison: the Spotify app takes up 26 MiB  which is less than a third. Fair enough that it requires iOS 13.5 - it's not your fault that Apple has only rolled out the API in user on that version - but to make it so big  it is to ensure that as few as possible I download it (so you do not have to look through so much data?
