Aggiornamento 27/07/2020
Purtroppo noto una assenza totale di risposte da parte degli sviluppatori e ciò non giova al buon funzionamento e ai miglioramenti della App.
Confermo quanto detto in precedenza. Ribadisco e aggiungo che:
- Se sono in casa Immuni non può chiedermi in continuazione di essere attivata. Si inserisca una modalità “casa” per cui l’app si metta a “dormire”;
-La segnalazione di eventuale positività non può essere di libero arbitrio altrimenti a che serve tutto ciò? Ci deve essere un modo per cui se io non lo faccio, qualcuno (autorità sanitarie, medici di base, ecc...) lo faccia al posto mio.","Well done.As the title suggests. Very simple and intuitive. We hope it serves the purpose for which it was designed. I hope that many will download it. Those who terrorize violated privacy understand zero. Just two notes: is it necessary to always keep it on even if I stay at home or I am alone in the car? It seems to me that it consumes a lot of battery. Another thing conflicts with my car's app that communicates via Bluetooth. But I recommend downloading it!
Update 27/07/2020
Unfortunately  I notice a total absence of responses from the developers and this does not help the smooth functioning and improvements of the App.
I confirm what was said previously. I repeat and add that:
- If I am at home  Immuni cannot ask me to be activated all the time. Enter a ""home"" mode for which the app goes to ""sleep"";
-The signaling of any positivity cannot be free will otherwise what is all this for?

La privacy è tutelata dal sistema di anonimato a codice variabile e da quanto verificato anche dai programmatori più scettici verificando il codice sorgente (disponibile gratuitamente per tutti) tutte le teorie complottiste sono venute a mancare poiché nulla di quanto predetto è stato inserito nell’app.

Cosa manca fondamentalmente a mio parere è l’estensione per  Watch che credo da questo punto di vista, più performante rispetto al solo iPhone. Inoltre ci vorrebbe un corridoio preferenziale sanitario per quanti hanno l’app e vengano avvisati di esposizione con potenziali contagiati, altrimenti l’averla scaricata e comunque dover passare per le classiche trafile sanitarie, non porta alcun beneficio concreto sul “dopo esposizione”. Un altro punto focale è la possibilità d’intercettare anche le esposizioni con cittadini stranieri che usano l’app relativa al proprio paese d’appartenenza (penso alla CoronaWarn App tedesca): intercettando anche le esposizioni coi cittadini stranieri si otterrebbe un sistema molto più performante in grado anche di intervenire tempestivamente in caso di contagio da turista. In questo un intervento 🇪🇺 sarebbe alquanto necessario.

Anche io come molti ricevo la strana notifica relativa alle esposizioni, ma pigiando sul tasto OK tutto torna alla normalità: credo derivi da qualche impostazione predefinita di iOS, nulla di allarmante insomma!

Privacy is protected by the variable code anonymity system and by what has been verified by even the most skeptical programmers by verifying the source code (available free of charge to all)  all conspiracy theories have ceased to exist because none of the above has been included in the app.

What is basically missing in my opinion is the extension for per Watch which I believe from this point of view  more performing than just the iPhone. In addition  a preferential health corridor would be needed for those who have the app and are warned of exposure with potential infected  otherwise having it downloaded and in any case having to go through the classic health drafts  does not bring any concrete benefit on ""after exposure"". Another focal point is the possibility of intercepting exhibitions with foreign citizens who use the app relating to their country of origin (I am thinking of the German CoronaWarn App): intercepting exhibitions with foreign citizens would also result in a much more efficient system. also able to intervene promptly in the event of a tourist infection. In this an intervention 🇪🇺 would be quite necessary.

Like many I also receive the strange notification relating to the exhibitions  but by pressing the OK button everything returns to normal: I think it comes from some default iOS setting  nothing alarming in short!

Richiede il solo utilizzo di notifiche e Bluetooth per funzionare, nessuna localizzazione, nessun gps, nessun dato personale richiesto. Chiunque accenni anche solo al contrario è un ciarlatano. 
La notifica del “potrebbe non funzionare qui” è dovuta al fatto che una delle due funzioni richieste del telefono vengono a meno, cioè hai spento il Bluetooth o hai tolto le notifiche. Non è la tua posizione che determina il funzionamento di tale strumento. Per quanto riguarda i falsi positivi, l’app ti notifica quando sei stato vicino ad un soggetto dichiarato positivo, ovviamente però non può sapere in che modo è avvenuto tale contatto. Richiedere le informazioni su dove e a che ora sei stato in contatto, viola la privacy che tanto la gente lamenta di mancare scaricando l’app. Se tutti quelli notificati rispettano gli obblighi di quarantena da esposizione, che sia un falso positivo o meno, non si rischierà più di tornare a marzo 2020.

Io ora posso usarla dato che ho un iphone abbastanza recente ma chi ha un iphone più veccho non può usare l’app. Inoltre dato che bisogna avere il telefono sempre all’ultima versione IOS tra poco non potrò più utilizzarla. Do 4 stelle e non 5 perché l’idea è ottima anche perché la nostra privacy è al sicuro con il sistema Bluetooth Low Energy ma è necessaria sempre l’ultima versione IOS. Per piacere risolvete questo problema delle versioni.,Excellent  but you have to put it also for previous versions of IOS In my opinion this is a great idea to start again as soon as possible and all Italians should install it so that it works. The only thing is that it must also be available for previous versions of IOS in order to be accessible to everyone. I can now use it since I have a fairly recent iPhone but those who have an older iPhone cannot use the app. Furthermore  since you must always have the latest IOS version of the phone  I will soon no longer be able to use it.

Non tanto sulla questione privacy, ma sulle modalità di rilevazione dei contatti e di valutazione e segnalazione del rischio. La mia preoccupazione riguarda soprattutto i falsi positivi. È giusto isolarsi se si è stati esposti al rischio di contagio, ma voglio assolutamente evitare di farlo solo per le approssimazioni dell’algoritmo dell’app. Qualora io venga a contatto con un positivo, l’app dovrebbe darmi tutti i dettagli in merito a quando ciò è avvenuto e dove, in modo che possa valutare se davvero sono stato esposto al contagio o se si tratta di un probabile falso positivo. Non mi è chiaro se, al momento, l’app lo faccia. Ci sono tutta una serie di situazioni in cui il rischio di falso positivo è elevato. Esempio, se mi trovo in auto e sono fermo nel traffico per mezz’ora vicino all’auto di un positivo, l’app mi segnalerà un rischio, anche se non c’è nessuna possibilità che io mi sia contagiato? A mio parere, questo è molto più importante che sapere come verranno gestiti i miei dati.",Some important points to clarify I downloaded the app  but I think there are still some aspects to clarify. Not so much on the privacy issue  but on the methods of identifying contacts and assessing and reporting risk. My concern is mostly about false positives. It is right to isolate yourself if you have been exposed to the risk of contagion  but I absolutely want to avoid doing it only for the approximations of the app algorithm. If I come into contact with a positive  the app should give me all the details about when this happened and where  so that I can assess whether I was really exposed to the infection or whether it is a probable false positive. It is not clear to me if  at the moment  the app does this. There are a number of situations where the risk of a false positive is high. For example  if I am in a car and I am stopped in traffic for half an hour near the car of a positive  the app will report a risk to me  even if there is no possibility that I am infected? In my opinion  this is much more important than knowing how my data will be handled.,it,Some important points to clarify I downloaded the app  but I think there are still some aspects to clarify  Not so much on the privacy issue  but on the methods of identifying contacts and assessing and reporting risk  My concern is mostly about false positives  It is right to isolate yourself if you have been exposed to the risk of contagion  but I absolutely want to avoid doing it only for the approximations of the app algorithm  If I come into contact with a positive  the app should give me all the details about when this happened and where  so that I can assess whether I was really exposed to the infection or whether it is a probable false positive  It is not clear to me if  at the moment  the app does this  There are a number of situations where the risk of a false positive is high  For example  if I am in a car and I am stopped in traffic for half an hour near the car of a positive  the app will report a risk to me  even if there is no possibility that I am infected  In my opinion  this is much more important than knowing how my data will be handled ,"Domain_Specific, Emotional, Privacy","concern, data, privaci, clarifi, identifi, import",0.075,Neutral,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0

Appare un messaggio “seleziona abilità nel pop-up che apparirà qui sotto”.

Ovviamente non appare nessun pop up nonostante i ripetuti tentavi e anche dopo avere eliminato e reinsatllato la app.

Vado allora nelle impostazioni per vedere di trovare tra le app installate oppure tra le notifiche o tra la privacy o all’interno di salute la possibilità “manuale” di autorizzare la app.

Niente da fare, nessuna traccia della app.
Allora provo sempre da Impostazioni ad usare il “cerca”. Niente da fare... immuni inesistente.

Vado nella parte notifiche e widget, cerco immuni, apro la app, ma la app si riapre sempre alla solita pagina “abilita le notifiche di esposizione al covid-19” ed ovviamente, cliccando su abilita, il famoso pop up che dovrebbe apparire... non appare.

1) in caso di positività, occorre andare in
- impostazioni
- caricamento dati
- comunicare il propio codice all’operatore sanitario
- attendere la conferma e lo sblocco della funzione
- verificare lo sblocco ed inviare il proprio “ 

Mi permetto di suggerire tasto rapido ed evidente per segnalazione di positività e procedura meno laboriosa.

2) era proprio impossibile escogitare qualcosa di più semplice ed immediato, magari “automatico” per chi non ha troppa dimestichezza con applicazioni? O per chi, per contingenza di cose (ricovero urgente, condizioni, ecc.) non riesce ad attivare lo stato di positività?

3) arriverà l’allerta con la quale si verrà avvisati che siamo stati vicini ad un positivo, senza sapere dove e quando. Ma veramente? Ovvio che non si potrà sapere chi, ma almeno in che luogo e quando...

4) avvisi di alert solo nel caso di distanza rilevata minore di un metro? Possibile? È così che funziona? Veramente sono convinti che un metro sia sufficiente? Però in spiaggia no. Però a scuola no. Però in chiesa no. Però ecc.

5) non accetto obiezioni sulla privacy quando si tratta di sicurezza. Dato che OGNI sito che visitiamo raccoglie i nostri dati e siamo pure contenti di conferirli. E non accetto obiezioni sulla sicurezza proprio da chi regala i propri dati (incluso i biometrici) per sapere “che personaggio Disney sei” oppure “quale ortaggio saresti” oppure “come sarai da vecchio”.

————
Speriamo in bene e che comunque, indipendentemente dalla “bontà” dell’app, quest venga utilizzata dal più possibile di persone","A little ""limited"" due to privacy restrictions If I understand correctly:

1) in case of positivity  it is necessary to go to
- settings
- Loading data
- communicate your own code to the health worker
- wait for confirmation and release of the function
- check the release and send your ""

Allow me to suggest a quick and obvious key for reporting positivity and a less laborious procedure.

2) was it really impossible to come up with something simpler and more immediate  perhaps ""automatic"" for those who are not too familiar with applications? Or for whom  due to the contingency of things (urgent hospitalization  conditions  etc.) fails to activate the state of positivity?

3) the alert will come with which you will be notified that we have been close to a positive  without knowing where and when. But really? Obviously it will not be possible to know who  but at least in what place and when ...

4) alerts only in the case of a detected distance of less than one meter? Possible? Is this how it works? Are they really convinced that one meter is enough? But on the beach no. But not at school. But in church no. But etc.

5) I don't accept privacy objections when it comes to security. Since EVERY site we visit collects our data and we are also happy to provide it. And I do not accept security objections from those who give their data (including biometrics) to know ""what Disney character you are"" or ""what vegetable would you be"" or ""how you will be when you are old"".

-a parte il fatto che un app (di certo non questa) avrebbe avuto la sua utilità ad inizio pandemia e non adesso, per monitorare spostamenti, focolai, ecc.

-non è obbligatorio scaricarla ed è necessario uno smartphone per poter essere utilizzata (quindi la stragrande maggioranza della popolazione non la scaricherà mai);

-come può avvisarmi di essere stato a contatto con una persona infetta se non è possibile inserire il proprio fascicolo sanitario, o perlomeno l’informazione di essere o essere stato contagiato? (Non mi informerà mai!)(Tralasciando il fatto che non vengono effettuati tamponi a richiesta...)

-a che serve inserire SOLO la mia regione e provincia di residenza senza dimostrare di viverci veramente? (o potrei anche semplicemente sbagliare a cliccare, può succedere);

-come posso essere avvisato dall’app o dal servizio sanitario di essere stato in una zona di focolaio o addirittura vicino ad una persona infetta, se la stessa app non monitora i miei spostamenti, non sa nulla del mio stato di salute e soprattutto non conosce la mia identità?

- How can you notify me of having been in contact with an infected person if it is not possible to enter your health file  or at least the information that you are or have been infected? (He will never inform me!) (Leaving aside the fact that there are no tampons on request ...)

- what is the use of entering ONLY my region and province of residence without proving that I really live there? (or I might just be wrong to click  it can happen);

-how can I be warned by the app or by the health service that I have been in an outbreak area or even close to an infected person  if the same app does not monitor my movements  does not know anything about my state of health and above all does not know my identity?

- una sezione nella quale inserire il proprio codice per attivare l’applicazione;

Mi pare di capire che attualmente lo scambio di codici tra persone che si incontrano avvenga automaticamente tramite la presenza in un certo range di distanza di due persone che hanno scaricato l’applicazione, o sbaglio?

I think there should be 2 different sections in which to insert the codes (currently I have only found one):
- a section in which to enter your code to activate the application;
- a section where you can contact the health worker using your code  to be used when you are positive or have symptoms.

Only the second of the two sections listed appears to be present in the app  although this is not really clear to me from the description.

Una volta scaricata la si lancia e la prima cosa richiesta è la verifica della corrente versione del S.O. iOS installata e, se necessario, t’invita ad effettuare un aggiornamento all’ultima versione disponibile.
Una volta aggiornato iOS, si riavvia liPhone e si rilancia l’App d’Immuni che, con pochi e semplici passaggi e qualche domanda si configura. Unica cosa che ti chiede è in quale Regione risiedi e in quale Provincia, poi, ti chiede di attivare il Bluetooth e t’informa su come funzionerà il monitoraggio ecc...

Per ora, diciamo che non ci sono stati problemi ne è stato complicato installare questa App. Inoltre è ben fatto e chiaro tutto il tutorial e le istruzioni di utilizzo.

App, completamente gratuita, anonima, infatti non ti chiede dati personali di nessun tipo, sicuramente da scaricare ed attivare perché, affinché il suo funzionamento sia davvero efficace e vi possa proteggere da eventuali infezioni accidentali, è fondamentale, che ci sia il più alto numero di utenze che lo utilizzino.

Once downloaded  it is launched and the first thing required is to check the current version of the S.O. iOS installed and  if necessary  invites you to update to the latest version available.
Once the iOS has been updated  restart the iPhone and relaunch the Immune App which  with a few simple steps and a few questions  is configured. The only thing it asks you is in which Region you reside and in which Province  then  it asks you to activate Bluetooth and informs you about how monitoring will work etc ...
