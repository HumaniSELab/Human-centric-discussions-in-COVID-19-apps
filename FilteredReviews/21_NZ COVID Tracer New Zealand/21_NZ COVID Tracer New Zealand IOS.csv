If you scan a QR code at a shop on the inbuilt camera, the camera detects the code but wants to take you to a website, then link to the App Store, before finally linking to the app. I.e., the code doesn’t take you straight from camera to app, which I expect in this day and age, and I think is essential so people find it just simple to use. Once you get to the app, you need to scan the code again as it’s forgotten where you are. But at this point it becomes straight forward: the app tells you where you are and records your visit. But I haven’t yet worked out how to view where I’ve been, because viewing my diary displays an empty screen with a lock symbol at the top, so I guess that doesn’t get unlocked until I hang out with an infected person?

They take your privacy very seriously but will share your IP address and history with other government agencies without specifying which agencies and under which conditions. 

That completely undermines any confidence in what is happening here. Also where is the data actually stored? In one place it says it is stored on the device and in other places says it is stored on government servers. Which is it or is it both? This detail is what makes and breaks confidence and trust. 

How did this app get released with such a woolly take on privacy in this day and age?

I have installed it and after this review will uninstall it.

Good on you for getting out an app so quickly under such time and privacy constraints, across two device platforms. 

I’m not personally 100% keen on the email and password data being hosted in Sydney on an AWS server, especially in a govt project, but as you’ve gone to the trouble of ensuring other data is both optional and locally kept, it’s an ease of implementation sacrifice I’ll live with.
 
Congratulations to this team, and I hope all of you get to stay home - and maybe enjoy a bit of a well-earned break!"," Ka pai Hey
