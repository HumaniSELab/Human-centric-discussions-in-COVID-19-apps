I understand the API is only available on devices that receive iOS 13.5 onwards but presumably it would improve the effectiveness of the app on such devices if the API was utilised.

In addition to my previous reviews below, I understand that Apple don’t approve apps that utilise undocumented/private APIs, but I would have thought that, given the current circumstances, they would be willing to make exceptions so apps like this can better integrate with the security features of iOS. This would be particularly important for devices that won’t receive iOS 13.4.5/13.5 and therefore won’t receive the Exposure Notification API feature that has been jointly developed by Apple and Google in response to the pandemic.

Update to my previous review: I’ve just discovered that the tick boxes I referred to are still there but you now have to scroll down from the green image, it simply wasn’t obvious there was more below this screen until I accidentally scrolled upwards while the image was displayed. Perhaps the fact there is more below the image could be made more obvious with a downward facing arrow, particularly when the app is unable to function, or better yet, the part of the screen containing the tick/crosses is brought up over the green image when the app is unable to function.

In addition to my previous review below, I think the update has lost some of the user friendliness that the first version had. The updated version no longer displays the four reasons why the app is unable to function e.g. permissions, Bluetooth disabled, etc. with a green tick or red cross and instead just displays text suggesting that the user should check permissions even if the reason is simply because Bluetooth is disabled. Also, the updated version of the app displays a green image, which is a universally understood indication that something is working, even if the app is unable to function, at the very least the image displayed should be red in colour if/when the app is unable to function.

Previous review:
Would it be possible to enable health officials to contact you if/when necessary and send the PIN for enabling access to the contact information through the app, in much the same way as Internet banking apps send One Time Passcodes, therefore removing the requirement to provide a phone number? This might result in a higher rate of adoption of the app by those concerned about their privacy and reduce the time it takes for our lives to start safely going back to normal."," An unfortunate necessity In addition to my previous reviews below  I’m surprised given what has unfolded in Victoria and the signs that NSW may soon follow  this app hasn’t been updated to utilise the Exposure Notification API that has been jointly developed by Apple and Google.

In addition to my previous review below  I think the update has lost some of the user friendliness that the first version had. The updated version no longer displays the four reasons why the app is unable to function e.g. permissions  Bluetooth disabled  etc. with a green tick or red cross and instead just displays text suggesting that the user should check permissions even if the reason is simply because Bluetooth is disabled. Also  the updated version of the app displays a green image  which is a universally understood indication that something is working  even if the app is unable to function  at the very least the image displayed should be red in colour if/when the app is unable to function.

Previous review:
Would it be possible to enable health officials to contact you if/when necessary and send the PIN for enabling access to the contact information through the app  in much the same way as Internet banking apps send One Time Passcodes  therefore removing the requirement to provide a phone number? This might result in a higher rate of adoption of the app by those concerned about their privacy and reduce the time it takes for our lives to start safely going back to normal. ",en, An unfortunate necessity In addition to my previous reviews below  I m surprised given what has unfolded in Victoria and the signs that NSW may soon follow  this app hasn t been updated to utilise the Exposure Notification API that has been jointly developed by Apple and Google  I understand the API is only available on devices that receive iOS      onwards but presumably it would improve the effectiveness of the app on such devices if the API was utilised   In addition to my previous reviews below  I understand that Apple don t approve apps that utilise undocumented private APIs  but I would have thought that  given the current circumstances  they would be willing to make exceptions so apps like this can better integrate with the security features of iOS  This would be particularly important for devices that won t receive iOS             and therefore won t receive the Exposure Notification API feature that has been jointly developed by Apple and Google in response to the pandemic   Update to my previous review  I ve just discovered that the tick boxes I referred to are still there but you now have to scroll down from the green image  it simply wasn t obvious there was more below this screen until I accidentally scrolled upwards while the image was displayed  Perhaps the fact there is more below the image could be made more obvious with a downward facing arrow  particularly when the app is unable to function  or better yet  the part of the screen containing the tick crosses is brought up over the green image when the app is unable to function   In addition to my previous review below  I think the update has lost some of the user friendliness that the first version had  The updated version no longer displays the four reasons why the app is unable to function e g  permissions  Bluetooth disabled  etc  with a green tick or red cross and instead just displays text suggesting that the user should check permissions even if the reason is simply because Bluetooth is disabled  Also  the updated version of the app displays a green image  which is a universally understood indication that something is working  even if the app is unable to function  at the very least the image displayed should be red in colour if when the app is unable to function   Previous review  Would it be possible to enable health officials to contact you if when necessary and send the PIN for enabling access to the contact information through the app  in much the same way as Internet banking apps send One Time Passcodes  therefore removing the requirement to provide a phone number  This might result in a higher rate of adoption of the app by those concerned about their privacy and reduce the time it takes for our lives to start safely going back to normal  ,"Disability, Domain_Specific, Emotional, Privacy","concern, secur, privaci, secur, disabl, reduc, remov, display, receiv, approv, import, imag, follow, normal",0.05714285714285714,Positive,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0

HOWEVER
I would like a feature where the app tells you at the end of the day how many other COVIDSafe app users you’ve encountered in the day. Or perhaps a counter that can be checked before and after an outing. 

I live in the city CBD and it would be nice to see if the app is actually working by checking how many people I’ve encountered. Then on a day you stay home you could check and see that you’ve only encountered your family members for example. 

That’s my number one concern with the app, you just open it and hope for the best. It would be nice if it gave you feedback that it’s colliding with other users and that it’s working. 

I don’t think I’m alone in feeling like the app is not doing anything, even if it is. Just because of how little it does once you open it.

You have to upload your data for it to be accessible  otherwise it is kept on your phone.
