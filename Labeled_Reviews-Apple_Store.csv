Was soll das?,"Zunächst: Toll, dass sie endlich da ist. Und das Interface für praktisch jedermann zu begreifen ist. ABER: Warum finde ich NIRGENDWO einen Hinweis dazu, ob das ganze eventuell auch bei ausgeschaltetem Bluetooth funktioniert bzw. steht in der App trotz ausgeschaltetem Bluetooth „Risiko-Ermittlung aktiv“ ?  Ich kann mir kaum vorstellen, dass dieser Punkt bei so einem Projekt nicht diskutiert wurde und bemitleide den/die App-Designer, denen dieser Punkt aus dem Must-Have-Katalog gestrichen wurde. Was soll das? Wer hat denn bitte dauerhaft Bluetooth an? Leider sehr, sehr peinlich. Nachbessern; sonst wird‘s nix mit dem Erfolg.

Edit nach Antwort durch RKI

Nur, um das Thema noch einmal zu verdeutlichen: Sie müssen den Leuten glasklar kommunizieren, wie diese App zu „bedienen“ ist. Mensch liest von „Bluetooth“ - denkt ergo daran, Bluetooth nun dauerhaft eingeschaltet haben zu müssen - so, als würde man sich verbinden wollen. Mensch installiert eine App - und nimmt an, dass sie/er eine App starten muss, damit etwas passiert. Gelerntes User-Verhalten eben. Beides jedoch ist hier nicht vonnöten. Und das muss den Leuten gesagt werden; wird es aber aktuell nirgendwo seitens der App selbst ider den FAQ, oder ...  Weshalb ich darauf herumreite: Jede nicht erfolgte Installation oder Deinstallation ist bei dieser App wirklich nicht nur schade, sondern mehr als auch nur ärgerlich. Insofern hoffe ich wirklich auf ein Update. Danke!",2,"What shoud that? First of all: it's great that it's finally here. And the interface can be understood by practically everyone. BUT: Why do I find NOWHERE a hint as to whether the whole thing works with Bluetooth switched off or does the app say ""risk determination active"" despite Bluetooth switched off? I can hardly imagine that this point was not discussed in such a project and I pity the app designer (s) for whom this point was deleted from the must-have catalog. What shoud that? Who has Bluetooth on permanently? Unfortunately  very  very embarrassing. Touching up; otherwise there will be no success.

Edit after answer by RKI

Just to clarify the subject once again: You have to communicate to people in a crystal-clear manner how to “use” this app. People read about “Bluetooth” - ergo thinks of having to have Bluetooth switched on permanently - as if one wanted to connect. Human installs an app - and assumes that she / he has to start an app for something to happen. Learned user behavior. However  neither is necessary here. And that has to be told to people; However  it is currently nowhere on the part of the app itself or the FAQ  or ... Which is why I argue about it: Any failed installation or deinstallation with this app is really not only a shame  but more than just annoying. So I really hope for an update.

Corona-Warn-App ist sinnvolle Ergänzung des Maßnahmenpakets,"Ich habe mir das Konzept der deutschen Corona-App und den Source-Code angeschaut und habe sie direkt installiert, weil sich mir der Sinn hinter der App erschließt. Aus meiner Sicht ist, durch die dezentrale Struktur in Sachen „Schutz persönlicher Daten“ und „Schutz der Bewegungsdaten“ von technischer Seite nichts dagegen einzuwenden. Die Corona-Warn-App alleine wird die Ausbreitung des Virus nicht verhindern, ich betrachte sie als sinnvollen Teil eines Maßnahmenpaketes.

Ein anderer Aspekt ist die langfristige Datenschutzfolgenabschätzung, die der technischen Entwicklung der App nun unbedingt folgen muss. Eine Corona-Warn-App darf nicht der schleichende Einstieg in die gesellschaftliche Tolerierung von persönlicher Kontakt- und Bewegungsüberwachung werden – sie muss eine Ausnahme in einer Ausnahmesituation bleiben.

Zu den teilweise auftretenden technischen Problemen der App ist zu sagen, dass durch die schnelle unter Zeitdruck stehende Entwicklung Fehler nicht ausbleiben. Die rasche Abfolge an Updates zeigt mir, dass man seitens der Entwickler die Probleme zügig angeht.",5,"Corona warning app is a useful addition to the package of measures. I looked at the concept of the German Corona app and the source code and installed them directly because the app makes sense to me. From my point of view  the decentralized structure in terms of ""protection of personal data"" and ""protection of movement data"" means that there is nothing wrong with this from the technical side. The corona warning app alone will not prevent the virus from spreading  I consider it a useful part of a package of measures.

Another aspect is the long-term data protection impact assessment  which must now follow the technical development of the app. A corona warning app must not become a creeping entry into the social tolerance of personal contact and movement monitoring - it must remain an exception in an exceptional situation.

Regarding the technical problems of the app that sometimes occur  it should be said that errors are inevitable due to the rapid development  which is under time pressure. The quick sequence of updates shows me that the developers are tackling the problems quickly.",,,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,

Ich habe geschrieben , dass die meldet, dass seit zwei Tagen keine hintergrundaktualisierung  stattgefunden hat.

Weder vor noch nach dem letzten Update.",1,"In the meantime very disappointed I promised myself so many positive things from the app. Data protection seems to be working. The error messages and background updates are not transparent for me as a user and therefore unreliable. The hotline was friendly  but couldn't convince. No background update for two days.

Thank you for the explanation of how the app should work. Offers to
 no solution to the problem described.

I wrote that it reports that there has been no background update for two days. The correction of the error should be resolved with a deactivation of the risk determination for 24 hours.

Anyone who complains about allegedly living in a totalitarian state is welcome to view the source code of the easy app. Accordingly  it is still not mandatory to download this program.

Auf älteren iOS Versionen kann eine App nur dann Bluetooth Daten per Bluetooth empfangen wenn sie gerade geöffnet ist (und nicht im Hintergrund). Da die Corona-Warn-App jedoch ständig auf Bluetooth zugreifen muss (auch wenn ihr das Handy nur in der Hosentasche habt) um sinnvoll zu funktionieren funktioniert das leider erst ab iOS 13.5 .

This is NOT a decision of the app developer! The app absolutely (!) Needs an interface that Apple only added with iOS 13.5. On older iOS versions  an app can only receive Bluetooth data via Bluetooth when it is currently open (and not in the background). However  since the Corona warning app has to constantly access Bluetooth (even if you only have the mobile phone in your pocket) in order to function properly  this unfortunately only works from iOS 13.5.

Top App!,"Top App, danke an alle die es möglich gemacht haben! Ich habe alle Vorurteile abgelegt und fühle mich Datentechnisch absolut sicher, da auch keine Standorte aufgezeichnet werden. 

An manche Kritiker: Die App ist absolut anonym, und warnt euch wenn ein anderer Nutzer der infiziert ist in den vergangenen Tagen in eurer Nähe war. Ihr habt dann ein paar Tage Vorsprung vor einem gefährlichen Virus!

Beispiel: Wenn ich mich nicht gut fühle, zum Doktor gehe, die Info bekomme, dass ich infiziert bin, und einen bestätigten Test habe. Dann lade ich einen anonymen Code hoch, den ich dann erhalte. Daraufhin bekommen alle Leute die innerhalb der letzten 14t zu mir Kontakt hatten eine Warnung, und haben Zeit gewonnen. Einfacher und anonymer geht nicht!

Akkuverbrauch ist absolut unauffällig.",5,"Top app! Great app  thanks to everyone who made it possible! I have put aside all prejudices and feel absolutely secure in terms of data technology  as no locations are recorded either.

To some critics: The app is absolutely anonymous and warns you if another infected user has been near you in the past few days. Then you have a few days ahead of a dangerous virus!

Example: If I am not feeling well  go to the doctor  get the information that I am infected and have a confirmed test. Then I upload an anonymous code which I then receive. Then all people who had contact with me within the last 14t receive a warning and have gained time. It couldn't be easier and more anonymous!

Aber es bleibt ja noch die in der App angegebenene Technische Hotline. Leider geht dort niemand dran, der technische Ahnung hätte, sondern nur eine freundliche, aber heillos überforderte Dame, die das Problem nicht versteht und auch nicht aufnimmt, um es weiterzugeben, die dann etwas sagt, von dem sie vermutlich denkt, es höre sich ‚irgendwie technisch‘ an und abschließend bedauert, dass die Kollegen von der „richtigen Technik“ leider sehr beschäftigt seien...

Unfortunately  nobody answers there who has a technical knowledge  but only a friendly  but hopelessly overwhelmed lady who does not understand the problem and does not take it up to pass it on  who then says something that she probably thinks sounds like ' somehow technical 'and finally regrets that the colleagues from the ""right technology"" are unfortunately very busy ...

First Impressions are Excellent,"I downloaded the app and got it working without any issues. 

Upon opening the app for the first time, it will make you swipe through some screens that explain how the app works to keep you safe and protect your privacy.

The app estimates how near people are by the strength of Bluetooth signals. It seems to set a high bar for what it records as an exposure. As it is now, it will only record an exposure if you are closer than 2 meters for 15 minutes. Apple’s and Google’s exposure notification API measures exposure duration in 5-minute increments, so I believe the 15-minute requirement could be adjusted down to 10 minutes or 5 minutes in the future if health authorities feel that is necessary.

As the bar seems to be set high for what is recorded as an exposure, if you do get a notification you should take it seriously and go get tested. 

There is really no reason to not download the app. It has been designed with privacy as the top priority, keeping your data in your hands. Apple has also designed the Exposure Notification API to be very lightweight and integrated with iOS, so it can run in the background without having a noticeable impact on battery life or performance.

Non scaricabile su cellulari meno recenti,"Buongiorno, mio padre mi ha chiesto di installargli l’app ma non ci sono riuscita perché il suo iPhone non consente l’aggiornamento ad iOS13. Molto anziani hanno cellulari poco recenti questo vincolo gli impedisce di installare Immuni.
Abbasserei anche l’età minima per l’installazione almeno a 12 anni, sono i ragazzi più giovani che non rispettano senza accorgersi il distanziamento",5,"Not downloadable on older mobile phones Hello  my father asked me to install the app for him but I couldn't because his iPhone doesn't allow the update to iOS13. Very old people have very recent cell phones this constraint prevents them from installing Immuni.
I would also lower the minimum age for installation to at least 12 years  it is the younger kids who do not respect without realizing the distance",,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1

Facile da Installare e configurare,"Per ora, il massimo che si può fare è andare sull’App Store di Apple, con il proprio Smartphone iPhone, che abbia un Sistema Operativo iOS almeno versione 13.0 o successiva, ed effettuare il download dell’App.
Una volta scaricata la si lancia e la prima cosa richiesta è la verifica della corrente versione del S.O. iOS installata e, se necessario, t’invita ad effettuare un aggiornamento all’ultima versione disponibile.
Una volta aggiornato iOS, si riavvia liPhone e si rilancia l’App d’Immuni che, con pochi e semplici passaggi e qualche domanda si configura. Unica cosa che ti chiede è in quale Regione risiedi e in quale Provincia, poi, ti chiede di attivare il Bluetooth e t’informa su come funzionerà il monitoraggio ecc...

Per ora, diciamo che non ci sono stati problemi ne è stato complicato installare questa App. Inoltre è ben fatto e chiaro tutto il tutorial e le istruzioni di utilizzo.

App, completamente gratuita, anonima, infatti non ti chiede dati personali di nessun tipo, sicuramente da scaricare ed attivare perché, affinché il suo funzionamento sia davvero efficace e vi possa proteggere da eventuali infezioni accidentali, è fondamentale, che ci sia il più alto numero di utenze che lo utilizzino.

Non dovete assolutamente temere per la vostra Privacy poiché, il funzionamento di questa App, è del tutto anonimo e non vengono tracciate le destinazioni o i percorsi fatti dall’utente ma solo un calendario con indicati quali altri utenti sono entrati nel campo di rilevamento, sempre attivo, dell’App. Ad ogni reale utenza viene assegnato un codice che rende completamente anonimo e sicuro il suo utilizzo. 
Inoltre, a meno che non ci s’infetta e si necessita di comunicare i propri archivi all’Asl , quest’ultimi sono archiviati, solo ed esclusivamente, nella memoria, protetta, del vostro Smartphone. E, comunque, anche nel caso doveste comunicare i vostri archivi in caso vi ammalaste, il Server dell’Asl, dopo aver utilizzato i vostri archivi per avvisare le altre utenze con le quali siete entrati in contatto, cancellerà tutti i vostri dati.",4,"Easy to Install and Configure For now  the best you can do is go to the Apple App Store  with your iPhone Smartphone  which has an iOS Operating System at least version 13.0 or later  and download the App.
Once downloaded  it is launched and the first thing required is to check the current version of the S.O. iOS installed and  if necessary  invites you to update to the latest version available.
Once the iOS has been updated  restart the iPhone and relaunch the Immune App which  with a few simple steps and a few questions  is configured. The only thing it asks you is in which Region you reside and in which Province  then  it asks you to activate Bluetooth and informs you about how monitoring will work etc ...

For now  let's say that there have been no problems nor has it been complicated to install this App. Furthermore  all the tutorial and instructions for use are well done and clear.

App  completely free  anonymous  in fact it does not ask you for personal data of any kind  certainly to be downloaded and activated because  in order for its operation to be really effective and can protect you from any accidental infections  it is essential that there is the highest number of users who use it.

You absolutely must not fear for your privacy since the operation of this App is completely anonymous and the destinations or routes made by the user are not tracked but only a calendar indicating which other users have entered the detection field  always active   of the App. Each real user is assigned a code that makes its use completely anonymous and safe.
Furthermore  unless we get infected and need to communicate their archives to the ASL  the latter are stored  only and exclusively  in the protected memory of your Smartphone. And  in any case  even if you have to communicate your archives in case you fall ill  the ASL Server  after using your archives to notify the other users with which you have come into contact  will delete all your data.",,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,
Immuni,"Non sono un programmatore, quindi non saprei se immuni funzioni o meno. È lì che gira in background. Nessun allarme finora. Lasciamo i nostri dati personali per tutto e a tutti (es. fidelity cards...) non vedo perché dovrei impuntarmi proprio per questa app.

Non è scaricabile per alcuni modelli di iPhone.,"Immuni è scaricabile solo con sistemi operativi aggiornati alla versione 13.5.1, ma chi possiede un iPhone 5 o 6 non può aggiornare a questa versione perché non supportata. Quindi non può scaricare immuni. Per cui pur volendo contribuire all’obiettivo sociale che questa app si è preposta, materialmente non si è in grado di farlo a meno di acquistare un altro cellulare di modello superiore! Ma vi sembra il caso?",2,It is not downloadable for some iPhone models. Immuni can only be downloaded with operating systems updated to version 13.5.1  but those who own an iPhone 5 or 6 cannot update to this version because it is not supported. So it cannot download immune.

Die Matching-Wahrscheinlichkeit – also die Tatsache, dass ein aufgezeichneter „Match“ auch ein tatsächlicher Kontakt innerhalb von zwei Metern ist – liege bei weniger als einem Promille, hieß es heute in einer Aussendung. Ein Lottogewinn sei wahrscheinlicher, die App gebe daher „falsche Sicherheit“.
Die App könne weder feststellen, ob jemandem die Hand gegeben wurde, noch, ob eine kontaminierte Fläche berührt wurde, so die ARGE Daten. Auch die technischen Möglichkeiten zur Distanzmessung sind für die Datenschutzorganisation unzureichend, da es an Genauigkeit fehle. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit, das über Bluetooth festzustellen, liege etwa „optimistisch geschätzt“ bei höchstens 25 Prozent.

„Von Exitstrategie keine Spur, eine ungeeignete Smartphone-App wird als Lösung aller Probleme verkauft“, lautet das Attest der ARGE Daten, die daher empfiehlt: „Finger weg von der App, vernünftige Distanz halten, regelmäßig Hände waschen!“",1,"Not compliant with the DSGVO - deleted again. You will not get my data with this implementation

Update:
""Stop Corona"" app  according to ARGE data  ""not practical""
The Red Cross “Stop Corona” app is “not practical” for ARGE Daten. The matching probability - i.e. the fact that a recorded ""match"" is also an actual contact within two meters - is less than one per thousand  according to a broadcast today. A lottery win is more likely  so the app gives ""false security"".
According to ARGE Daten  the app can neither determine whether someone has been shaken or touched a contaminated surface. The technical possibilities for distance measurement are also inadequate for the data protection organization  as there is a lack of accuracy. The probability of ascertaining this via Bluetooth is roughly ""optimistically estimated"" at a maximum of 25 percent.

""There is no trace of an exit strategy  an unsuitable smartphone app is sold as the solution to all problems""  is the certificate from ARGE Daten  which therefore recommends: ""Stay away from the app  keep a reasonable distance  wash your hands regularly!""",,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,

Berechtigung für Mikrofon,"Echt coole und auch wichtige App, gerade in der modernen Zeit von Behörden und öffentlichen Stellen die Smartphones so intelligent zu nutzen.

Aber Zugriff auf Mikrofon um über Ultraschall andere Handys zu orten, mag funktionieren oder nicht, will ich auch nicht drüber urteilen, bin kein Experte und meine Meinung ist auch irrelevant wenn es um so ein wichtiges Thema wie das Covid-19 geht, aber das kann einige Nutzer abschrecken und vor allem abhalten die App zu nutzen, was ja gerade wichtig wäre, denn umso mehr Bürger die App nutzen desto besser funktioniert sie auch. 
Daher wäre es auch wichtig öffentlich Werbung dafür zu machen und auch die „Angst“ zu nehmen, man würde abgehört werden.

Was auch noch hilfreich wäre, wenn die App mit dem Apple Covid-19 Kontaktprotokoll zusammen arbeiten würde, was mit dem Update 13.5 gekommen ist.",4,"Authorization for microphone Really cool and also important app  especially in modern times for authorities and public bodies to use smartphones so intelligently.

Warum ich Whatsapp nicht verwende und die Stopp Corona app schon,"Als vor einigen Jahren whatsapp von facebook gekauft wurde habe ich whatsapp auf meinem Handy deinstalliert. 

Warum? 

Whatsapp speichert zwar keine Dateninhalte- diese sind ja nachweislich beinAktivierung verschlüsselt- aber

wer kommuniziert mit wem (gelinkt mit deiner Telephon ID) 
Wann und wie lange wird kommuniziert
Wo befindest du dich zu dem Zeitpunkt
Das Adressbuch von jedem Handy wird ebenfalls auf Matching contacts gescanned
Falls du dich jemals gewundert hast wie es facebook schafft dir uralte vergessene Bekannte  vorzuschlagen- nun: vielleicht helfen diese sachdienlichen Hinweise.

Das ist in der Tat big data. 

Genauso wie 

-jede Googlesuche (speichert deine IP Adresse und deine Suchen)

deine Uber  fahrten
Deine Amazonkaeufe
Deine Facebook likes 
All das gibt einer amerikanischen Datenkrake alles was es braucht um mehr ueber dich zunwissen als du selbst. Bekanntlich sind ja so Wahlen in den USA hewonnen worden (vgl. Dazu Cambridge Analytica...)

Daher verwende ich 

threema statt whatsapp
Duckduckgo statt google
Kein facebook
Oesterreichische versandonline webplattformen
Nun zur Coronaapp:

Diese speichert einen anonymen Schluessel einer anderen Begegnung via Bluetooth - derzeit noch durch aktives Abgleichen, demnächst auch automatisch (Ultraschall - und ja das braucht das Mikro!) - mit einem Zeitstempel. 

Die Daten werden lokal verschluesselt abgelegt und sind NICHT mit deiner oder der anderen Telephonnummer verknüpft. 

Bei einem Verdachtsfall wirst du benachrichtigt dass du durch einen verknüpften Kontakt der krank geworden ist, selber eine Gefährdung fuer andere darstellen koenntest (folge : testen, uU präventive Selbst-Quarantäne,...) -

Deine Personal ID wird dabei nicht mit einer Telephonnummer aufgeloest. 

Deswegen halte ich es fuer eine sehr sinnvolle die Demokratie nicht gefaehrdende Massnahme (im Vergleich zu Facebook oder whatsapp...) stopp corona zu installieren. 

 VIelen Dank liebes Rot Kreuz Team!!

(Und open Source waere es noch einfacher den Beweis anzutreten! Deswegen nur 4 Sterne - noch!)",4,"Why I don't use Whatsapp and the Stop Corona app already When facebook bought whatsapp a few years ago  I uninstalled whatsapp on my mobile phone.

Why?

Whatsapp does not save any data content - these are verifiably encrypted when activated - but

who communicates with whom (linked to your phone ID)
When and for how long will the communication take place
Where are you at the moment
The address book of every cell phone is also scanned for matching contacts
If you've ever wondered how Facebook manages to suggest ancient  forgotten acquaintances - well: maybe these pertinent hints will help.

This is big data indeed.

As well as

-Each Google search (saves your IP address and your searches)

your Uber rides
Your Amazon purchases
Your Facebook likes
All of this gives an American data octopus everything it needs to know more about you than you do. It is well known that elections were won in the USA (see Cambridge Analytica ...)

So I use

threema instead of whatsapp
Duckduckgo instead of google
No facebook
Austrian shipping online web platforms
Now to the Coronaapp:

This saves an anonymous key of another encounter via Bluetooth - currently still through active synchronization  soon also automatically (ultrasound - and yes  the microphone needs that!) - with a time stamp.

The data is stored locally encrypted and is NOT linked to your or the other telephone number.

In the event of a suspected case  you will be notified that you yourself could pose a risk to others through a linked contact who became ill (follow: testing  possibly preventive self-quarantine  ...) -

Your Personal ID will not be resolved with a telephone number.

That is why I think it is a very sensible measure that does not endanger democracy (compared to Facebook or whatsapp ...) to install stop corona.

 Thank you dear Red Cross team !!

(And open source would make it even easier to prove it! That's why only 4 stars - still!)",,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,

Mängel,"Fehlende Erklärung innerhalb der App wieso Zugriff aufs Mikrofon gewährt werden muss.

Fehlende Auswahl, das Mikrofon nicht als Erkenner zuzulassen. Das sollte ja auch ohne gehen? Für die, die Überwachung befürchten.

Fehlende Erklärung wieso das ganze nicht ohne Ultraschall auch umsetzbar ist.

Wenn man so eine eindeutig „potentiell kontroverse App“ herausbringt, dann sollte man es gleich richtig machen. Weil wenn sich schonmal eine negatige Stimmung im Land breit gemacht hat, dann wird‘s schwer, das Vertrauen wiederzugewinnen. 

Die Entwickler der App haben hier eine extreme Verantwortung, welcher sie sich offensichtlich nicht genug bewusst waren.

Wie wäre es zum Beispiel mit einer Video-Vorschau, im App Store unter der App, in der jegliche Fragen/Zweifel beantwortet und entkräftigt werden?",4,"Deficiencies Lack of explanation within the app why access to the microphone must be granted.

Missing explanation in the app store description why access to the microphone must be granted.

Lack of choice not to allow the microphone as a recognizer. That should work without it? For those who fear surveillance.

No explanation why the whole thing cannot be implemented without ultrasound.

If you bring out such a clearly ""potentially controversial app"" then you should get it right right away. Because if a negative mood has spread across the country  it will be difficult to regain trust.

"Gute Idee, absolut schlecht umgesetzt","Liebes RKO, an sich ist die Grundidee der App ja gut. Das Problem ist, dass dem hochsensiblen Thema Datenschutz und Privatsphäre nicht genug Rechnung getragen wird. Bei der Identifizierung und Tracking von Kontakten sowie der Verwendung von Bluetooth und des Mikrofons müsst ihr viel proaktiver auf die Bedenken eingehen. Ich kann niemanden empfehlen diese App zu verwenden solange nicht alle diese Punkte geklärt sind:
- Zugriff auf das Mikrofon öffnet potentiell die Tür zum Abhorchen. Es muss auch ohne dem Mikrofon gehen.
- Wer bekommt Zugriff auf meine Daten? Wie lange werden sie gespeichert? Wie kann ich eine Löschung beantragen? Das sind alles klassische DSGVO Fragen die bei so einer App ganz kritisch sind.
- Source Code muss offen gelegt werden.

Zur Verwendung dieser App brauche ich extrem viel Vertrauen in den richtigen Umgang mit der Technologie und meinen Daten. Klärt und kommuniziert die obigen Punkte öffentlich, dann kann vielleicht Vertrauen entstehen. Bis dahin: Finger weg davon!",1,"Good idea  absolutely badly implemented Dear RKO  the basic idea of ​​the app is actually good. The problem is that the highly sensitive issue of data protection and privacy is not given enough consideration. You need to be much more proactive in addressing concerns when it comes to identifying and tracking contacts  as well as using Bluetooth and the microphone. I cannot recommend anyone to use this app until all of these points have been clarified:
- Access to the microphone potentially opens the door to eavesdropping. It has to work without the microphone.
- Who can access my data? How long are they stored? How can I request a deletion? These are all classic GDPR questions that are very critical with such an app.
- Source code must be disclosed.
