Firstly this app forced people to buy a compatible phone and now with all bugs in app your desk want people to buy another sim. From the reviews it is apparent that even after having new sim there is no guarantee the app will get activated. We understand your concern for the system security. However to make life easy for app users pease advise your team to reset the activation counts for genuine users. Thanks.,  There is a need MOI to review their support desk.
