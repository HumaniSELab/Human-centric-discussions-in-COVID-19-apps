I am once again writing to beg of you to please make the correction on my Aarogya Setu App. It has caused me so much grief that I really don't know why there is no correction window.

To start the story again: My house help Suresh Kumar Verma who was at his house and was to resume duty was sent by me for a Covid Test.

To book the test there was a phone number asked for sending a confirmation OTP. Since he is not good with the phone, I gave my number ie. 98210 68351.

He tested positive on 28th June and it came on my App that the owner of this number is Positive. I am not Suresh Kumar Verma, this is not his number and I had only done it to help book his appointment. As soon as I saw this, I started mailing and calling all helplines but till now there has been no correction.

In the bargain, I am stopped from entering many offices/shops and salons and now need to fly to Delhi on work on 22nd July but will possibly not be allowed on the flight.

I have then undertaken a covid test on 9th July which was Negative and by now even my servant Suresh Kumar Verma is Negative. There is still no change on the status of my App even after this.

PLEASE EARNESTLY REQUEST YOUR INTERVENTION. HOW CAN NO ONE HELP. PLEASE PLEASE DO SOMETHING. THIS IS UNTOLD TRAUMA.

In the bargain my husband, Ricki Kapoor's number also shows at moderate risk (98200 34403).

Attaching all reports but please help.
Suresh's mobile number is 99875 32608 and 99693 28886.

While standalone Aarogya Setu app is a novel beginning in Govt.s task of identifying COVID patients, there is a large majority which don’t know about it or don’t want to download it due to privacy concerns.  

I would like to suggest that the Govt. with 
co-operation with top Indian & International app developers( Widely used apps) make the Aarogya Setu app module attached to their app for next 60 days via an update to their app.

This would mean if I use Whatsapp & next time I open the app, the app will ask me to update it before I can use it. The app update will take me to the Aarogya Setu module & will ask me basic questions & the process flow of Aarogya Setu will follow. Obviously, user’s security & safety of his private information within the app is ensured 100%.

The Aarogya Setu app could be attached to following:

1)Whatsapp, 2) Facebook, 3)Twitter, 4) Instagram

इसे install करना क्यों आवश्यक हैं...

आपमें से बहुतों ने इनस्टॉल किया...
पर आपको लगा कि बकवास हैं...
इसे आपने uninstall भी कर दिया होगा...

मैंने भी दो तीन बार install किया... फिर हटा दिया...
पर मोदी जी ने फिर से बोला तो सोचना पड़ा...
ये जरूर कोई बहुत बड़ी चीज हैं...

आप भी फिर से आरोग्य सेतु एप को install कीजिए...
मोदी जी ने चार बार आपसे निवेदन किया है...

अब जानिए...

यह एप्प आपसे कुछ पूछता है जैसे कि क्या आपको खांसी हैं...
बुखार हैं...
सांस लेने में परेशानी हैं...

निश्चित है आप लिखेंगे...
नहीं हैं...

उसके बाद आप ग्रीन जोन में दिखते होंगे...
आपको लगता होगा...
इस एप्प में कुछ हैं ही नहीं...
पूरा बकवास हैं...

यह एप्प ब्लू टूथ और लोकेशन को ऑन रखने को कहता हैं...
आप always on रखिये...

जब भी आप किसी भीड़ भाड़ वाली जगह पर जाते हैं...
यह एप्प ब्लू टूथ से आस पास के मोबाइल से संदेश लेता देता रहता हैं...

जब आप किसी के पास खड़े हैं तो आप भी ग्रीन जोन के हैं...
पास खड़ा व्यक्ति भी ग्रीन जोन वाला नार्मल व्यक्ति ही हैं...
पर अगर वह व्यक्ति आज से 10 दिनों बाद किसी कारण से कोरोना पॉजिटिव हो जाएगा...
तो यह एप्प आपको तुरंत alert कर देगा...
और आपका ग्रीन कलर बदल कर ऑरेंज या पीला हो जाएगा।

यह कहेगा...
आप दूध लेने आज से 10 दिन पहले डेयरी पर गए थे...
वह व्यक्ति जो नीले शर्ट वाला था...
वह अब कोरोना पॉजिटिव हैं...
यानी 10 दिन पहले उसे छिपा हुआ संक्रमण था जो अब साफ-साफ दिखने लगा हैं...

अब आप तुरंत अपनी जांच कराइए...
साथ ही यह एप्प उन सभी व्यक्तियों को सूचना दे देगा...
आप सभी लोग उस आदमी के चलते danger zone में आ गए हैं...
तुरंत जांच कराइये।

सबकी लोकेशन ऑन रहने से उन सभी की मूवमेंट भी पता चलेगी...
और कोरोना से लड़ना आसान होगा...

आप इस पोस्ट को व्हाट्सएप्प पर भेजिए...
लोगों को समझाइए...
जिस दिन करोड़ों लोग इसे install कर लेंगे...
यह आपके किसी भी ऑरेंज जोन के व्यक्ति के पास जाते ही रिंग करने लगेगा...
यह आपको हॉट स्पॉट की सूचना अलार्म से दे देगा...
ताकि आप रास्ता बदल लें...

मित्रों..
मोदी जी ने 4 बार निवेदन किया तो यह बेकार का एप्प नहीं हो सकता...

But you thought that nonsense ...
You must have uninstalled it as well…

I also installed two or three times ... then removed ...
But Modi ji said again  he had to think ...
This is definitely a big thing ...

You can also install the Arogya Setu app again ...
Modi ji has requested you four times…

Now know ...

This app asks you something like if you have a cough ...
Fever ...
Trouble breathing ...

Sure you will write…
Are not ...

After that you will be seen in Green Zone…
you would think...
There is nothing in this app ...
Complete nonsense ...

This app tells to keep blue tooth and location on ...
You always keep on ...

Whenever you go to a crowded place ...
This app keeps sending messages from nearby mobiles with blue tooth ...

When you are standing next to someone  you also belong to the green zone ...
The person standing nearby is also a normal person with a green zone ...
But if that person becomes corona positive for some reason after 10 days from today ...
So this app will alert you immediately…
And your green color will change to orange or yellow.

It will say…
You went to the dairy 10 days before taking milk ...
The person who was in the blue shirt…
He is now Corona positive ...
That is  10 days ago he had a hidden infection which is now clearly visible ...

Now make your inquiry immediately ...
Also this app will give information to all those people…
All of you have come to the danger zone because of that man ...
Check immediately.

By keeping everyone's location on  they will also know the movement of all of them ...
And fighting Corona would be easy ...

Send this post to Whatsapp ...
Explain to people ...
The day millions of people will install it…
It will ring as soon as you go to any of the people of Orange Zone ...
This will alert you of the hot spot by alarm ...
So that you change the way…

Friends ..
If Modi ji has requested 4 times  it cannot be a useless app…
Install it immediately ...",hi

Ur initiative is wonderful.

But there is a possibility that a person infected don’t update his details.

The best way to do it is, once a person is tested positive, his Aadhar number should be collected at the hospital or lab. And informed to the Arogya Setu app team. They should take care of finding all the family members mobile numbers and trace the IMEI numbers. So whenever other people Mobil phone crosses the IMEI number .. the other people should be alerted with a message to be cautious and take self test... 

Two things to look into...

1. The information of the patient is not made public..
2. Even though the family members donor have mobile or this app installed is not an issue.. 

This module should work every time a mobile happens to cross another mobile in vicinity.. this might look too complex, but now only few people come out.. so not an issue.

1) If any person is infected you register his number to alert the once coming in the radius of tracking. 
   Along with his number, force the person's family & latest meets number as well & provide notification accordingly.
   This can be used as a flag that the person in vicinity was nearby & thin chances of him as well being infected. 

2) Monitor movement of individual.
   Assume person ""X"" is not infected, but in this lock-down situation he is traveling to places regularly.
   While installing the application Take Home location & track if this location travels regularly, if yes ring him & alert.
   If he is government employee or else differentiate him accordingly.

  This will not just help us in this lock-down, but even after some days of resume period, if he travels much a notification can be sent and alerted accordingly."," Suggestion as an improvement Its a phenomenal step NIC has taken in too short span of panicking situation.

Thanks a lot for this app.

Just a thought, is it possible to add a feature to Track people who will be Travelling to India from Other Countries.

At present you have asked Users to declare their travel history but considering post Lockdown situation you can also ask potential travellers to feed info on Travel and track it as well.

Let us know if it would be helpful.
