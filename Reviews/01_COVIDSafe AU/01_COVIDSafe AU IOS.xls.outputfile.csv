I understand the API is only available on devices that receive iOS 13.5 onwards but presumably it would improve the effectiveness of the app on such devices if the API was utilised.

In addition to my previous reviews below, I understand that Apple don’t approve apps that utilise undocumented/private APIs, but I would have thought that, given the current circumstances, they would be willing to make exceptions so apps like this can better integrate with the security features of iOS. This would be particularly important for devices that won’t receive iOS 13.4.5/13.5 and therefore won’t receive the Exposure Notification API feature that has been jointly developed by Apple and Google in response to the pandemic.

Update to my previous review: I’ve just discovered that the tick boxes I referred to are still there but you now have to scroll down from the green image, it simply wasn’t obvious there was more below this screen until I accidentally scrolled upwards while the image was displayed. Perhaps the fact there is more below the image could be made more obvious with a downward facing arrow, particularly when the app is unable to function, or better yet, the part of the screen containing the tick/crosses is brought up over the green image when the app is unable to function.

In addition to my previous review below, I think the update has lost some of the user friendliness that the first version had. The updated version no longer displays the four reasons why the app is unable to function e.g. permissions, Bluetooth disabled, etc. with a green tick or red cross and instead just displays text suggesting that the user should check permissions even if the reason is simply because Bluetooth is disabled. Also, the updated version of the app displays a green image, which is a universally understood indication that something is working, even if the app is unable to function, at the very least the image displayed should be red in colour if/when the app is unable to function.

Previous review:
Would it be possible to enable health officials to contact you if/when necessary and send the PIN for enabling access to the contact information through the app, in much the same way as Internet banking apps send One Time Passcodes, therefore removing the requirement to provide a phone number? This might result in a higher rate of adoption of the app by those concerned about their privacy and reduce the time it takes for our lives to start safely going back to normal."," An unfortunate necessity In addition to my previous reviews below  I’m surprised given what has unfolded in Victoria and the signs that NSW may soon follow  this app hasn’t been updated to utilise the Exposure Notification API that has been jointly developed by Apple and Google.

Why? It entirely breaks the Bluetooth connection between Apple Watch and the phone. As a result;
- even though I have “block all unknown callers” enabled, Apple Watch rings every single time an unknown number calls and no record of the call appears in the recents section on the phone - iPhone has no idea the call occurred!!
- music playing, fitness tracking, auto-unlock, remote cancelling of alarms; none of it works from Apple Watch
- the watch battery drains faster because it’s constantly connecting directly to the mobile network even though my phone is less than a metre from it.

This app does not work  it does not (it cannot) communicate with Bluetooth  unless your iPhone is unlocked and this app is running in the foreground. The Bluetooth security of an iPhone simply does not allow it to connect to another phone if your iPhone is locked or you are running another app.

No one is going to walk around with their iPhone unlocked  nor are they going to make sure this app is running into the foreground all the time. Are you doing this? If not the app is doing nothing.

Lock your iPhone screen - the app stops working.
Use another app  make a call  send a message  play a game  do anything else - the app stops working.

They must implement the new Apple-Google APIs which have recently been published with iOS 13.5 for it to work  securely and privately in the background  and until they do this the app literally does nothing. Switzerland are the first (and currently only) country to have done this to date.

Anyone who thinks this app will do anything otherwise is being fooled. It is not making you safe  it is not making anyone with an iPhone safe  and it is being greatly misrepresented by the government and its app developers. ",en

Following the instructions in the app, you are instructed to register with your Full name in the format  (first, last)  eg Fred, Smith   If you do this, the app will not successfully register later. However you wont know this at the time. It will simply tell you at the next step that your phone number is incorrect and that you must enter an Australian phone number. 
At that point it further tells you to enter your mobile number in international format beginning +61 ... which should normally mean removing the leading zero. Entering your number in either format and submitting the PIN request you get a message that there is an error verifying your phone number. But this is because of the name error.

Registration fails until you 1) remove the comma you are told to add in your name, and 2) add the zero you are told to leave out of your mobile number.

I wonder how many haven’t completed registration because of following the instructions carefully?"," Error in sign up instructions. Shareing a troubleshooting experience with a friend who tried to install this.

While I believe that vaccines have their merits, they are not as safe as made out by the mainstream media.

I vehemently oppose mandatory vaccination for multiple reasons. Most importantly, mandatory vaccination leads to reduced responsibility for vaccine manufacturers. Also, mandatory vaccination forces the individual to accept all the risks while removing the right to compensation except in cases of blatant culpability.

I am surprised that it isn’t mandatory to get a clean bill of health immediately prior to each vaccination. This way reactions would have to be attributed to either the vaccine or to an examination error. Either way an investigation would have to be carried out in every case of an adverse reaction."," Deleted to protest mandatory vaccination Deleted the COVIDSafe app to protest against the mandatory flu vaccination of the NRL players.

What will this mean for drug dealers, already struggling to reorganise their supply chains after having been hit by the pandemic? It may surprise you to hear that many are not covered by the force majeure clauses that you and I take for granted.

And what about men who cheat on their wives. As if it wasn’t hard enough for them to do so in self-isolation, now they will have to worry about the government tracing app. Think of the plight of Barnaby Joyce for one.

Yes, this app may help us return to some degree of normalcy in society. Yes, it may allow us to share more time with friends and family, to free the aged from a terrible period of isolation. Yes, it may help restore employment and self-fulfilment to the millions who have been rendered unemployed by the virus.

But I ask you, is it really worth the cost?"," The human toll of the COVIDSafe app Sure this app may save lives. But what about the untold cost to privacy?
