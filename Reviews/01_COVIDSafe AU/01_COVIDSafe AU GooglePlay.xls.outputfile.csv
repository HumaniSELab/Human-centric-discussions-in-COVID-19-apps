In the mean time, I start with a major issue; 1. The app is significantly disruptive to bluetooth audio streaming. Causing the audio to pause every few seconds.

Phones in the vicinty can disrupt the audio playing from another phone's bluetooth. Switching off bluetooth in the nearby phones stopped the breaks in the audio streaming.
